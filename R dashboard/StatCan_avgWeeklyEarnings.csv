Symbol legend:
F,too unreliable to be published,
A,data quality: excellent,
B,data quality: very good,

Footnotes:
1,"The quality indicators take into account various factors that affect the quality of the data, notably the CV, the non-response errors and the imputation errors. Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent; B - Very good; C - Good; D - Acceptable; E - Use with caution; F - Too unreliable to publish or sample size is too small to produce reliable estimates."
2,The introduction of administrative data in 2001 and the associated change in methodology resulted in level shifts for some series. This affects the comparability of pre- and post-2001 estimates.
3,Earnings data are based on gross payroll before source deductions.
4,Industry estimates in this table are based on the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Version 3.0.
5,"""All employees"" is the sum of employees paid by the hour, salaried employees and other employees."
6,"Industrial aggregate covers all industrial sectors except those primarily involved in agriculture, fishing and trapping, private household services, religious organisations and the military personnel of the defence services."
7,Unclassified businesses (00) are businesses for which the industrial classification (North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] 2017 Version 3.0) has yet to be determined.
8,"Goods producing industries (11-33N) includes the following sectors: forestry, logging and support (11N), mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (21), utilities (22), construction (23) and manufacturing (31-33)."
9,"Service producing industries (41-91N) includes the following industries: trade (41-45N), transportation and warehousing (48-49), information and cultural industries (51), finance and insurance (52), real estate and rental and leasing (53), professional, scientific and technical services (54), management of companies and enterprises (55), administrative and support, waste management and remediation services (56), educational services (61), health care and social assistance (62), arts, entertainment and recreation (71), accommodation and food services (72), other services (except public administration) (81) and public administration (91)."
10,"Although the creation of Nunavut officially took place in April 1999, the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) was only able to begin publishing separate estimates for Northwest Territories and Nunavut with the release of the January 2001 data. Efforts were undertaken to estimate the employment for Nunavut back to April 1999. These are available upon request by contacting Client Services (toll-free: 1-866-873-8788; statcan.labour-travail.statcan@canada.ca), Labour Statistics Division."
11,"Since January 2001, the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) program no longer combines Northwest Territories and Nunavut. They are produced as two separate territories."
