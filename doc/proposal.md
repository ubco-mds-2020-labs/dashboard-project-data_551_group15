# Project Proposal

## Motivation and purpose

**Our role:** Data scientist consultancy firm

**Target audience:** Canadian citizens, researchers and decision makers. General public. 

Gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices, also known as nominal GDP, is the sum of gross value added, measured at constant prices, by households, government, and industries operating in the economy for a certain period of time. It accounts for all domestic production, regardless of whether the income accrues to domestic or foreign institutions.

The purpose of this analysis is to provide access to accurate, up-to-date GDP data and information for past and current economic analysis using this metric. It will provide a measure of the economic production which takes place at the provincial and territorial level of Canada from an industry point of view.

We propose developing a dashboard that will show a map of Canada displaying the total amount, percentage, and the yearly and cumulative growth rate of GDP for each Province and Territory of Canada. It will allow users to explore different aspects of this data by selecting the Province or Territory of interest to display information on it its biggest industries and filtering and re-ordering by date.

## Description of the data

The “Canada Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry, provinces and territories” dataset, available from Canada's national statistical office, Statistics Canada, at https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3610040201, provides Annual Provincial and Territorial Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at basic prices (from 1997 to 2019), by North American Industry Classification aggregates, in chained (2012) and current dollars (dollars x 1,000,000).

## Research questions and usage scenarios

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be thought of as an overall grade on the economic report card of a country, region or industry. GDP is the metre stick of an economy. Broadly, when it's increasing, the economy is said to be growing. If GDP is slowing down or negative, it can be an early sign of recession. 

GDP provides a comprehensive measure of economic activity. The growth rate of GDP is the most popular indicator of a nation's overall economic health.

Our dashboard will be publicly available and will inform business decision-makers, researchers, and the general public on Canada's economic state and progress.
